#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
* **var** → old way, function-scoped
* **let** → block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.
* **const** → block-scoped, can’t be reassigned.
#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
* **forEach()** → loops, doesn’t return anything.
* **map()** → loops and returns a new array.
* **filter()** → loops and returns a new array with only items that pass a condition.
